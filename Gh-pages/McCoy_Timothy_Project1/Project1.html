    <p>Hello my eager to learn friends welcome to my beginner's HTML tutorial. I would suggest practicing this on weebly with the embed code or Custom html dragover.The first thing you ALWAYS have to add is a doctype statement by putting it in as follows: "!DOCTYPE html" when you do that you exchange the quotation marks for these: <>. Those are tags and they go around every statement. When I use quotations be sure to know that I mean these: <> Now, always put "html" right after your doctype statement on the next line and to close it you put "/html". The backslash means that it is a closing statement which is basically like the reciprocal of the first tag, thus completing the statement. In between the two html tags you made you make a line and there is where you start.</p>
    <h3>Listing</h3><ol><li>List item 1</li><li>List item 2</li>Unordered List</ol> <p>That is what is known as an "unordered list which consists of a ol tag demonstrated as "<>" and "li" tags on the inside to verify the number of listing items and what they say. Next, you will be shown the ordered list which consists of actual numbers rather than dots.</p>
    <ol><li>Listing item</li><li>Another Listing item</li>Ordered List</ol>
