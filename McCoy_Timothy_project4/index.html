      <h3 id="types">Types & Type Advantages</h3>
      <p>All Pokemon have a type and some Pokemon can be dual typed Pokemon just like how their skills can be dual typed as well. All of the known types are normal, water, electric, fighting, ground, psychic, rock, dark, steel, fire, grass, ice, poison,
        flying, bug, ghost, dragon, and fairy. These types hold great significance because they determine how much damage will be dealt with that specific move and how it will affect that certain Pokemon. These are more commonly known as "Type Advantages"
        and they help you greatly throughout the entire storyline.</p>
